<h1>About</h1>
<p><em>Where's My Bus?</em> is an Android app that helps riders of King County Metro buses find information about why their buses may be stalled in unusual circumstances. Riders can use our app to communicate with each other about issues with bus routes and any circumstances in a particular neighborhood of Seattle that might affect buses by</p>

<ul>
  <li>submitting information about issues they might have experienced on the bus</li>
  <li>viewing alerts submitted by other users to learn about problems</li>
  <li>posting questions to which other users can respond through comments</li>
</ul>

<p>King County Metro can also use <em>Where’s My Bus?</em> to submit alerts for riders. With this information from <em>Where’s My Bus?</em>, riders can then determine if they should delay their plans or find an alternate means of transportation.</p>
